# Privacy Policy

## What data do we collect?

We store the GuildID, RoleID, UserID, ChannelID, OwnerID of the Guild, (and MessageID) as soon as you execute a configuration command correctly, e.g. if you execute `/welcome setup <#Channel> [Custom Message]`, then we store the GuildID / ServerID in the data and also the ChannelID as well as the Custom Message (if this was specified).

## Why do we need the data?

We need this data for support, functionality of the bot (this includes setup of a module of our bot), user experience, control growth.

## How we use the datas?

The data is used for growth, marketing, functionality, support, user experience.



## Other than Discord (the company) and users of our own bot on Discord (the platform), who do we share collected data with, if anyone?&#x20;

We do not share data with third parties because we care about the safety of the bot's users.

## How can users contact us if they have concerns about our bot?

You can ask us a question about the Privacy Policy via privacy@lixoja.xyz and a general question via support@lixoja.xyz.

## How can you remove the datas?&#x20;
